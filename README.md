# StudentDropoutPrediction
Setting up-  and optimizing machine learning models in order to achieve best performance for predicting student dropouts. This was a part of my final exam project for a machine learning course I attended as part of my masters in Data Science. It is a group effort and was created together with 3 of my fellow students. 

The analysis is based on a public dataset provided by SATDAP - Capacitação da Administração Pública project funded by POCI-05-5762-FSE-000191 (Portugal) and is available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Two files has been uploaded - a 15 page report containing all the findings of the project as well as a notebook containing all the code that forms the basis of the project.
